# Day 8

For Day 8, I followed the second coding tutorial from FlowerLabs.

Here's what they cover:

- All the preparatory phase of the first tutorial (data splitting for simulation, client creation, etc.).
- Customizing a federated learning strategy (e.g., FedAvg) to suit specific requirements.
- Fine-tuning client-server interactions to optimize the performance of the federated system.
- Exploring how to adjust parameters such as the fraction of clients participating in training rounds, the evaluation fraction, and minimum client counts for a robust and scalable setup.
- Gaining hands-on experience in extending the Flower framework to fit custom use cases, a skill that's critical for advanced federated learning workflows.

This tutorial really connects the dots between foundational knowledge and practical implementation, making it a highly engaging and useful exercise. Highly recommend it!
