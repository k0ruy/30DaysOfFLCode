# Day 4

Goal: Introduction to Flower FL framework.

> [!NOTE]  
> **In short:**
> Flower provides the infrastructure needed for federated learning, evaluation, and analytics, enabling seamless training, evaluation, and aggregation of machine learning models across decentralized systems. It supports any workload, ML framework, and programming language, making federated workflows scalable, easy, and secure.


# Summary
In the Flower tutorial, they explain the basics of FL and its workings. Moreover, they go over these 3 additional topics.

## Federated Evaluation
Federated Evaluation assesses machine learning models on decentralized client data to obtain metrics, just as models are trained on such data. It is a critical component of federated learning systems.

## Federated Analytics
Federated Analytics enables insights from distributed data without requiring machine learning. For example, it can answer queries like the average age of a health condition onset by analyzing data across multiple client nodes. Privacy-enhancing techniques like secure aggregation are often used to protect individual data during analysis.

## Differential Privacy
Differential Privacy is a technique ensuring participant privacy during data analysis or sharing by adding statistical noise to data updates. It prevents individual data points from being re-identified, offering a measurable level of privacy protection.
