# Day 7

Goal: Finish studying [Model aggregation techniques in federated learning: A comprehensive survey](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167739X23003333)

## Challenges in Aggregation
- Data Heterogeneity: Non-IID data across clients leads to significant variations in local models, reducing aggregation efficiency.
- Communication Constraints: Aggregation requires frequent exchange of updates, which can strain bandwidth and energy resources, particularly in resource-constrained environments like IoT.
- Adversarial Threats: Aggregators must defend against model poisoning attacks, where malicious clients intentionally skew updates to degrade global model performance.
- Scalability: The increasing number of clients in FL systems creates computational and communication bottlenecks in aggregation processes.

## Applications
The paper highlights the application of these techniques in diverse sectors, including:

- Healthcare: Aggregating patient data models from hospitals while maintaining privacy.
- Finance: Secure aggregation of fraud detection and risk assessment models.
- Smart Devices and IoT: Aggregation in decentralized networks for personalized recommendations and device optimization.
- Edge Computing: Enhances AI performance across distributed edge devices.

## Future Directions
- Hybrid Aggregation Techniques: Combining robustness, efficiency, and privacy-preservation in a single framework.
- Adaptive Aggregation: Developing algorithms that dynamically adjust aggregation strategies based on client data distribution and resource availability.
- Scalable Frameworks: Ensuring aggregation methods are efficient for large-scale deployments.
- Integration with Blockchain: Using decentralized ledgers to verify the integrity of model updates and aggregation.


>[!TIP]
>This survey emphasizes the critical role of aggregation in the success of FL systems and provides a roadmap for enhancing model aggregation techniques to address the technical, privacy, and security challenges in federated learning.
